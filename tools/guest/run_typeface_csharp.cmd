rem NO ASSET LINE HERE, and that is the change: `asset(name)`
rem resolves the vendored font in the core, out of the root the
rem deploy stages and names machine-wide in KAYA_ASSET_DIR. A

rem new asset cost five more of these lines.

set DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT=1
rem ms-appx resolves against the PROCESS exe's directory: the
rem APPHOST exe (not dotnet.exe) runs from C:\kaya\cs-out, built
rem ONCE at deploy with kaya's minimal resources.pri beside it (the
rem per-leg builds raced the shared obj\ and cs-out, CS2012).
