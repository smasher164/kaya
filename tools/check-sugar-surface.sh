# The sugar-surface guard: every widget kind in the spec must have a

# rather than a matter of memory. Kinds come from the GENERATED python
# wire file, so the list tracks the spec by construction.
#
# Matching is by each binding's naming convention, prefix-loose so a
# language's flavor counts (Haskell's checkboxOn matches "checkbox",
# Go's Checkbox matches "checkbox"). C is exempt: it is the function
